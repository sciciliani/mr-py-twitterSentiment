2012-01-22 14:10:47,Rupert Murdoch ,,,80,Copyright piracy.  Everyone now agrees is stealing and wrong.   So why all the hysteria?  Why not discuss and settle on cure?
2012-01-20 15:46:46,Rupert Murdoch ,,,115,Mega loads!    One week earlier and things would be different.   Even some solons may have recovered their courage.
2012-01-19 21:44:37,Rupert Murdoch ,,,66,Carried interest tax racket.  Billions over many years.   Why and where has Obama been?
2012-01-18 22:27:07,Rupert Murdoch ,,,154,On SOPA  where are all big film stars with many millions to lose?
2012-01-18 22:21:47,Rupert Murdoch ,,,228,"Romney tax uses long-term legal loophole. ""carried interest"" makes all fund managers rich.  Time both parties stopped selling  out to Wall S"
2012-01-18 02:43:41,Rupert Murdoch ,,,153,Don't care about people not buying movies  programs or newspapers  just stealing them.
2012-01-18 02:39:38,Rupert Murdoch ,,,78,AFL-CIO supporting SOPA!
2012-01-18 00:15:14,Rupert Murdoch ,,,118,When will Romney get a manager to prepare him?   Fancy not being ready for questions about taxes or felons! Damaging.
2012-01-18 00:03:22,Rupert Murdoch ,,,199,Seems blogosphere has succeeded in terrorizing many senators and congressmen  who previously committed.  Politicians all the same.
2012-01-17 20:50:46,Rupert Murdoch ,,,115,Nonsense argument about danger to Internet.  How about Google  others blocking porn  hate speech  etc?  Internet hurt?
2012-01-17 20:47:20,Rupert Murdoch ,,,65,Big bipartisan majorities both houses sold out by POTUS for search engines.  How about 2.2 m workers in entertainment industry? Piracy rules
2012-01-17 20:43:48,Rupert Murdoch ,,,127,Gloom!  Seems all economists predict long  major recession mostly Europe. Few ideas to change course.  Poor will be hurt most. Greece worst.
2012-01-16 06:19:48,Rupert Murdoch ,,,35,Yes  thanks  of course I meant POTUS.  Somehow iPad changed my spelling. I should have checked. Sorry.
2012-01-16 06:12:09,Rupert Murdoch ,,,26,Just for the record  cinemas average well over half ticket money.
2012-01-16 05:56:12,Rupert Murdoch ,,,40,More pirates.  Whole entertainment ind employs 2.2 million ave salary 65 g. Good jobs and expanding foreign earnings. Made in America  too!
2012-01-16 05:50:50,Rupert Murdoch ,,,50,Seems like universal anger with Optus from all sorts of normal supporters.  Maybe backing pirates a rare miscalculation by friend Axelrod.
2012-01-16 05:47:34,Rupert Murdoch ,,,31,Golden Globes great night for whole creative tam at Fox.  Congrats!  Best pic Descendants  best tv show Modern Family and many other wins.

2012-01-15 16:34:00,Rupert Murdoch ,,,54,Sure misunderstand many things  but not plain stealing. Incidentally google blocks many other undesirable things.

2012-01-15 03:19:09,Rupert Murdoch ,,,30,Understand more than all allege!  Google great company doing many exciting things. Only one complaint  and it's important.
2012-01-14 22:57:56,Rupert Murdoch ,,,88,Film making risky as hell. This has to lead to less  hurting writers  actors  all concerned.
2012-01-14 22:54:19,Rupert Murdoch ,,,696,Piracy leader is Google who streams movies free  sells advts around them.  No wonder pouring millions into lobbying.
2012-01-14 22:42:04,Rupert Murdoch ,,,342,So Obama has thrown in his lot withSilicon Valley paymasters who threaten all  software creators with piracy  plain thievery.  -

2012-01-14 06:58:41,Rupert Murdoch ,,,306,Normally disapprove of casinos but hitting 16s and 17s lot of fun.  To hell with theories!
2012-01-13 21:14:57,Rupert Murdoch ,,,14,Calling Cuomo chicken only related to teacher evaluation. He has 70 per cent approval  so let's see him use it for education.
2012-01-13 19:00:46,Rupert Murdoch ,,,53,Art market ablaze. See WSJ today on China  and eleven simultaneous Damien Hirst shows in Gargosian galleries. Flight from cash?
2012-01-13 14:47:22,Rupert Murdoch ,,,21,Last day here.  Most top Newscorp execs will huddle to review their own digital efforts and plan forward.
2012-01-13 14:42:13,Rupert Murdoch ,,,129,CES wrapping up. All talk is about coming Apple tv.   Plenty of apprehension  no firm facts but eyes on their enormous cash pile.
2012-01-13 07:05:19,Rupert Murdoch ,,,2009,Many questions and jokes about My Space.simple answer -  we screwed up in every way possible  learned lots of valuable expensive lessons.
2012-01-12 19:36:37,Rupert Murdoch ,,,49,CES again.  Big three Apple Google and Amazon  and maybe Facebook dominant now and growing.  Plenty of others good  but not in same league.
2012-01-12 19:33:17,Rupert Murdoch ,,,28,CES coming to a close.  Seems like more innovation than ever  some great  all disruptive.  Traditional coys  feeling digital tornado
2012-01-12 19:28:05,Rupert Murdoch ,,,24,Bloomberg's bold teacher proposals today terrific.   How will chicken Cuomo respond? If UFT refuses this money good teachers will scream.
2012-01-11 15:06:05,Rupert Murdoch ,,,72,Jack. Tokyo sounds great but be careful of that full moon
2012-01-11 14:24:33,Rupert Murdoch ,,,93,Can't blame Newt G too much.  He was carpet bombed with negatives by Romney. Brilliant  visionary but just too much baggage!  And erratic.
2012-01-11 14:15:40,Rupert Murdoch ,,,75,Re education. Equality of opportunity IS possible.  Country must fix K-12 everywhere. Politicians need disconnect from rich teacher unions.
2012-01-11 14:10:30,Rupert Murdoch ,,,36,LasVegas showing amazing new gizmos  but real deals off show floor.  Google  extremely active.  Much better company under Larry Page
2012-01-11 14:02:29,Rupert Murdoch ,,,54,Big win for Romney  now strong favorite. Owes a lot to Christie who energized R with great effect. Transformed R into real campaigner
2012-01-10 19:34:45,Rupert Murdoch ,,,100,For those interested in art try beautiful new site http://t.co/JiOXkkmS
2012-01-10 15:29:36,Rupert Murdoch ,,,171,Education only way to real equality. US a disgrace. Millions every year headed for underclass or worse.   Half kids drop out  in LA   others
2012-01-09 22:07:26,Rupert Murdoch ,,,191,George Soros @WSJ.com predicting awful deflation and trouble nearly everywhere. He knows  this stuff.  Let's see if he is right again.
2012-01-09 22:01:51,Rupert Murdoch ,,,28,So Bill Daley has followed Rahm  as reported in the Journal few weeks ago ( and  denied).   What's going on  premature electioneering?
2012-01-09 21:55:10,Rupert Murdoch ,,,138,Re complaints about my spelling!    Problem is my pathetic typing.  Sorry  if anyone really cares.
2012-01-09 00:27:28,Rupert Murdoch ,,,80,Second thoughts! Content does remain king  but new tech will help improve much  especially education.
2012-01-09 00:21:37,Rupert Murdoch ,,,46,Obama out to lunch!  90 per cent right on great issues of education and immigration. Bipartisan support mostly there. Why no leadership?
2012-01-09 00:13:31,Rupert Murdoch ,,,46,Santorum right.  America a big  good society capable of anything.  Not libertarian!

2012-01-04 21:47:57,Rupert Murdoch ,,,70,Can understand OCW resentment of extreme inequalities  but how about  fund managers only paying cap gains tax without risking a penny?
2012-01-04 16:02:51,Rupert Murdoch ,,,199,Paul too  extreme  but right to draw attention toFed.   Printing zillions can only cause inflation - the coward's way out of this mess.
2012-01-04 15:58:48,Rupert Murdoch ,,,143,Well  well!   Values DO count. Santorum result pretty amazing.   Policy very similar to Reagan.  Now start to sound like him.
